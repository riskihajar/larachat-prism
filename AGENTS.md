# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.16
- inertiajs/inertia-laravel (INERTIA) - v2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/nightwatch (NIGHTWATCH) - v1
- laravel/octane (OCTANE) - v2
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- tightenco/ziggy (ZIGGY) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v3
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- rector/rector (RECTOR) - v2
- @inertiajs/vue3 (INERTIA) - v2
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4
- vue (VUE) - v3
- eslint (ESLINT) - v9

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `bun run build`, `bun run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== herd rules ===

## Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate URLs for the user to ensure valid URLs.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(s). It is _always_ available through Laravel Herd.


=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.


=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

## Inertia Core

- Inertia.js components should be placed in the `resources/js/Pages` directory unless specified differently in the JS bundler (vite.config.js).
- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of traditional Blade views.
- Use `search-docs` for accurate guidance on all things Inertia.

<code-snippet lang="php" name="Inertia::render Example">
// routes/web.php example
Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
        'users' => User::all()
    ]);
});
</code-snippet>


=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

## Inertia v2

- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 & v2. Check the documentation before making any changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.

### Inertia v2 New Features
- Polling
- Prefetching
- Deferred props
- Infinite scrolling using merging props and `WhenVisible`
- Lazy loading data on scroll

### Deferred Props & Empty States
- When using deferred props on the frontend, you should add a nice empty state with pulsing / animated skeleton.

### Inertia Form General Guidance
- The recommended way to build forms when using Inertia is with the `<Form>` component - a useful example is below. Use `search-docs` with a query of `form component` for guidance.
- Forms can also be built using the `useForm` helper for more programmatic control, or to follow existing conventions. Use `search-docs` with a query of `useForm helper` for guidance.
- `resetOnError`, `resetOnSuccess`, and `setDefaultsOnSuccess` are available on the `<Form>` component. Use `search-docs` with a query of 'form component resetting' for guidance.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `bun run build` or ask the user to run `bun run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests which have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider going with this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>


=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

## Inertia + Vue

- Vue components must have a single root element.
- Use `router.visit()` or `<Link>` for navigation instead of traditional links.

<code-snippet name="Inertia Client Navigation" lang="vue">

    import { Link } from '@inertiajs/vue3'
    <Link href="/">Home</Link>

</code-snippet>


=== inertia-vue/v2/forms rules ===

## Inertia + Vue Forms

<code-snippet name="`<Form>` Component Example" lang="vue">

<Form
    action="/users"
    method="post"
    #default="{
        errors,
        hasErrors,
        processing,
        progress,
        wasSuccessful,
        recentlySuccessful,
        setError,
        clearErrors,
        resetAndClearErrors,
        defaults,
        isDirty,
        reset,
        submit,
  }"
>
    <input type="text" name="name" />

    <div v-if="errors.name">
        {{ errors.name }}
    </div>

    <button type="submit" :disabled="processing">
        {{ processing ? 'Creating...' : 'Create User' }}
    </button>

    <div v-if="wasSuccessful">User created successfully!</div>
</Form>

</code-snippet>


=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>


### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.


=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4 - do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.
<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>


### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option - use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |


=== prism-php/prism rules ===

## Prism

### Package Overview
- Prism is a powerful Laravel package for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications with a fluent, expressive API.
- Prism supports multiple AI providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Mistral, Groq, XAI, Gemini, VoyageAI, ElevenLabs, DeepSeek, and OpenRouter.
- Always use the `Prism` facade, class, or `prism()` helper function for all LLM interactions.
- Prism draws inspiration from the Vercel AI SDK, adapting its concepts for the Laravel ecosystem.

### Basic Usage Patterns
- Use `Prism::text()` for text generation, `Prism::structured()` for structured output, `Prism::embeddings()` for embeddings, `Prism::image()` for image generation, and `Prism::audio()` for audio processing.
- Always chain the `using()` method to specify provider and model before generating responses.
- Use `asText()`, `asStructured()`, `asStream()`, `asEmbeddings()`, etc. to finalize the request based on the desired response type.
- You can also use the fluent `prism()` helper function as an alternative to the Prism facade.

<code-snippet name="Basic Text Generation" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\Prism;
use Prism\Prism\Enums\Provider;

$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
    ->withPrompt('Explain quantum computing to a 5-year-old.')
    ->asText();

echo $response->text;

// Or using the helper function
$response = prism()
    ->text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
    ->withPrompt('Explain quantum computing to a 5-year-old.')
    ->asText();
</code-snippet>

### Provider Configuration
- Provider configurations are stored in `config/prism.php` and typically use environment variables.
- The `Provider` enum provides type safety when specifying providers.
- Configuration can be overridden dynamically using the third parameter of `using()` or `usingProviderConfig()`.

<code-snippet name="Provider Usage with Configuration" lang="php">
// Basic provider usage
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4o')
    ->withPrompt('Generate a product description')
    ->asText();

// Override config inline
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4o', ['url' => 'custom-endpoint'])
    ->withPrompt('Generate content')
    ->asText();

// Or using usingProviderConfig()
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4o')
    ->usingProviderConfig(['url' => 'custom-endpoint'])
    ->withPrompt('Generate content')
    ->asText();
</code-snippet>

### Structured Output
- Use `Prism::structured()` when you need predictable, typed responses from LLMs.
- Define schemas using Prism's schema classes: `ObjectSchema`, `StringSchema`, `NumberSchema`, `ArraySchema`, `BooleanSchema`, etc.
- **IMPORTANT**: For OpenAI structured output (especially strict mode), the root schema MUST be an `ObjectSchema`. Other schema types can only be used as properties within an ObjectSchema.
- Different providers support either structured mode (strict schema validation) or JSON mode (approximate schema matching).
- Access structured data via `$response->structured` which returns a PHP array.
- Consider validating structured responses based on your application's needs.

<code-snippet name="Structured Output with Schema" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\Prism;
use Prism\Prism\Schema\ObjectSchema;
use Prism\Prism\Schema\StringSchema;
use Prism\Prism\Schema\NumberSchema;

// Root schema must be ObjectSchema for OpenAI
$schema = new ObjectSchema(
    name: 'product',
    description: 'Product information',
    properties: [
        new StringSchema('name', 'Product name'),
        new StringSchema('description', 'Product description'),
        new NumberSchema('price', 'Price in dollars'),
    ],
    requiredFields: ['name', 'description', 'price']
);

$response = Prism::structured()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4o')
    ->withSchema($schema)
    ->withPrompt('Generate a product for a coffee shop')
    ->asStructured();

// Access structured data
$product = $response->structured;
if ($product !== null) {
    echo $product['name'];
}
</code-snippet>

### Streaming Responses
- Use `asStream()` for real-time response streaming, especially for long-form content generation.
- Always iterate through stream chunks and handle them appropriately for your application.
- Streaming works seamlessly with tools - you can detect tool calls and results in the stream.
- Consider using Laravel's event streaming capabilities for frontend integration.
- Be aware that Laravel Telescope may interfere with streaming - disable it if needed.

<code-snippet name="Streaming Text Generation" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\Enums\ChunkType;

$stream = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt('Write a detailed article about renewable energy')
    ->asStream();

foreach ($stream as $chunk) {
    echo $chunk->text;
    // Process each chunk as it arrives
    ob_flush();
    flush();
    
    // Check for final chunk
    if ($chunk->finishReason === FinishReason::Stop) {
        echo "Generation complete!";
    }
}

// Streaming with tools
$stream = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4o')
    ->withTools([$weatherTool])
    ->withMaxSteps(3)
    ->withPrompt('What\'s the weather like in San Francisco?')
    ->asStream();

foreach ($stream as $chunk) {
    // Check chunk type for tool interactions
    if ($chunk->chunkType === ChunkType::ToolCall) {
        foreach ($chunk->toolCalls as $call) {
            echo "Tool called: " . $call->name;
        }
    } elseif ($chunk->chunkType === ChunkType::ToolResult) {
        foreach ($chunk->toolResults as $result) {
            echo "Tool result: " . $result->result;
        }
    } else {
        echo $chunk->text;
    }
}

// Laravel 12 Event Streams
Route::get('/chat', function () {
    return response()->eventStream(function () {
        $stream = Prism::text()
            ->using('openai', 'gpt-4')
            ->withPrompt('Explain quantum computing step by step.')
            ->asStream();

        foreach ($stream as $response) {
            yield $response->text;
        }
    });
});
</code-snippet>

### Multi-Modal Inputs
- Prism supports images, documents, audio, and video inputs alongside text prompts.
- Use appropriate value objects: `Image::fromLocalPath()`, `Document::fromLocalPath()`, `Audio::fromPath()`, etc.
- Images can be loaded from local paths, storage disks, URLs, or base64 data.
- Documents support PDF and other formats, with optional titles for better context.
- Provide descriptive text in your prompts along with media for better results.
- Check provider support tables as not all providers support all modalities.

<code-snippet name="Multi-Modal Input Example" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Media\Image;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Media\Document;

// Image from local path
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4o')
    ->withPrompt(
        'Analyze this image and describe what you see',
        [Image::fromLocalPath('/path/to/image.jpg')]
    )
    ->asText();

// Image from storage disk
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt(
        'What is in this image?',
        [Image::fromStoragePath('images/photo.jpg', 'public')]
    )
    ->asText();

// Document analysis
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt(
        'Summarize this document',
        [Document::fromLocalPath('report.pdf', 'Quarterly Report')]
    )
    ->asText();
</code-snippet>

### Tools and Function Calling
- Use the `Tool` facade to define functions that LLMs can call during generation.
- Tools have names, descriptions, and parameters that the LLM can use.
- **IMPORTANT**: When using tools, set `withMaxSteps(2)` or higher to allow multi-step interactions.
- Prism defaults to a single step, but tools require at least 2 steps (tool call + response).
- Supports multiple parameter types: string, number, boolean, enum, array, and object parameters.

<code-snippet name="Tool Definition and Usage" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\Facades\Tool;

$weatherTool = Tool::as('weather')
    ->for('Get current weather conditions')
    ->withStringParameter('city', 'The city to get weather for')
    ->using(function (string $city): string {
        // Your weather API logic here
        return "The weather in {$city} is sunny and 72°F.";
    });

$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
    ->withMaxSteps(2) // Required for tools!
    ->withPrompt('What is the weather like in Paris?')
    ->withTools([$weatherTool])
    ->asText();

// Complex tool with multiple parameter types
$calculatorTool = Tool::as('calculator')
    ->for('Perform mathematical calculations')
    ->withStringParameter('expression', 'Mathematical expression to calculate')
    ->withBooleanParameter('round_result', 'Whether to round the result', false)
    ->using(function (string $expression, bool $roundResult = false): string {
        $result = eval("return $expression;");
        return $roundResult ? (string) round($result) : (string) $result;
    });

// Custom tool class example
class WeatherTool extends Tool
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this
            ->as('weather')
            ->for('Get current weather information for a city')
            ->withStringParameter('city', 'The city name to get weather for')
            ->withStringParameter('units', 'Temperature units (celsius/fahrenheit)', false)
            ->using($this);
    }

    public function __invoke(string $city, string $units = 'celsius'): string
    {
        // Your weather API implementation
        $weatherData = $this->fetchWeatherData($city, $units);
        
        return "Weather in {$city}: {$weatherData['temperature']}°" . 
               ($units === 'celsius' ? 'C' : 'F') . 
               ", {$weatherData['condition']}";
    }

    private function fetchWeatherData(string $city, string $units): array
    {
        // Implementation would call actual weather API
        return [
            'temperature' => 22,
            'condition' => 'Sunny'
        ];
    }
}

// Usage
$weatherTool = new WeatherTool();
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
    ->withMaxSteps(2)
    ->withPrompt('What\'s the weather like in London?')
    ->withTools([$weatherTool])
    ->asText();
</code-snippet>

### System Prompts and Context
- Use `withSystemPrompt()` to set behavior, persona, or context for the LLM.
- System prompts help maintain consistent behavior across interactions.
- Laravel views can be used for both system prompts and regular prompts for dynamic content.
- For conversation history, use `withMessages()` with message objects instead of single prompts.

<code-snippet name="System Prompt Usage" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Messages\UserMessage;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Messages\AssistantMessage;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Messages\SystemMessage;

$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withSystemPrompt('You are a helpful assistant.')
    ->withPrompt('Review this code and suggest improvements')
    ->asText();

// Using Laravel views for dynamic prompts
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
    ->withSystemPrompt(view('prompts.code-review-assistant', ['language' => 'PHP']))
    ->withPrompt($codeToReview)
    ->asText();

// Views work with regular prompts too
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
    ->withPrompt(view('prompts.analysis-request', ['data' => $analysisData]))
    ->asText();

// For conversations, use messages
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withMessages([
        new UserMessage('What is JSON?'),
        new AssistantMessage('JSON is a lightweight data format...'),
        new UserMessage('Can you show me an example?')
    ])
    ->asText();
</code-snippet>

### Testing with Prism
- Use `Prism::fake()` in tests to avoid making real API calls.
- Use response fake builders like `TextResponseFake::make()` for fluent test setup.
- Provide expected responses that match your testing needs.
- Test both successful responses and error conditions.
- Use Prism's assertion methods to verify requests, prompts, and provider configurations.

<code-snippet name="Testing with Prism Fake" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\Prism;
use Prism\Prism\Testing\TextResponseFake;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Usage;

it('generates text responses', function () {
    $fakeResponse = TextResponseFake::make()
        ->withText('Generated response text')
        ->withUsage(new Usage(50, 25));

    $fake = Prism::fake([$fakeResponse]);

    $response = Prism::text()
        ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
        ->withPrompt('Test prompt')
        ->asText();

    expect($response->text)->toBe('Generated response text');
    
    // Assert on the request
    $fake->assertPrompt('Test prompt');
    $fake->assertCallCount(1);
    $fake->assertRequest(function ($requests) {
        expect($requests[0]->model())->toBe('gpt-4');
    });
});

// Testing multiple responses (for tool usage)
it('handles tool calls', function () {
    $responses = [
        TextResponseFake::make()->withToolCalls([/* tool calls */]),
        TextResponseFake::make()->withText('Final response after tool execution'),
    ];

    $fake = Prism::fake($responses);
    // Test your multi-step interaction
});
</code-snippet>

### Response Handling and Finish Reasons
- Always check finish reasons to understand why generation stopped.
- Handle multi-step responses when using tools by examining each step.
- Access token usage statistics for monitoring and cost management.
- Use response messages to maintain conversation history.

<code-snippet name="Complete Response Handling" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\Enums\FinishReason;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Messages\AssistantMessage;

$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt('Explain quantum computing.')
    ->asText();

// Check why generation stopped
switch ($response->finishReason) {
    case FinishReason::Stop:
        echo "Generation completed normally";
        break;
    case FinishReason::Length:
        echo "Generation stopped due to max tokens";
        break;
    case FinishReason::ContentFilter:
        echo "Content was filtered";
        break;
    case FinishReason::ToolCalls:
        echo "Generation stopped for tool calls";
        break;
}

// Access token usage
echo "Prompt tokens: {$response->usage->promptTokens}";
echo "Completion tokens: {$response->usage->completionTokens}";

// For multi-step generations (with tools)
foreach ($response->steps as $step) {
    echo "Step text: {$step->text}";
    echo "Step tokens: {$step->usage->completionTokens}";
    
    // Check for tool calls in this step
    if ($step->toolCalls) {
        foreach ($step->toolCalls as $call) {
            echo "Called tool: {$call->name}";
        }
    }
}

// Access conversation history
foreach ($response->responseMessages as $message) {
    if ($message instanceof AssistantMessage) {
        echo "Assistant said: {$message->content}";
    }
}
</code-snippet>

### Error Handling
- Consider wrapping Prism calls in try-catch blocks based on your application's error handling strategy.
- Handle specific Prism exceptions appropriately: rate limits, API errors, validation failures.
- Implement fallback behavior when LLM calls fail as needed.

<code-snippet name="Error Handling" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\Exceptions\PrismException;

try {
    $response = Prism::text()
        ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
        ->withPrompt('Generate content')
        ->asText();
        
    return $response->text;
} catch (PrismException $e) {
    // Handle Prism-specific errors
    return 'Content generation temporarily unavailable';
}
</code-snippet>

### Audio Processing
- Use `Prism::audio()` for both text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) functionality.
- For TTS, specify voice and audio format options through provider-specific settings.
- For STT, provide audio files using the `Audio` value object from local paths or storage.
- Audio responses provide base64-encoded data that you can save to files or stream directly.

<code-snippet name="Audio Processing Examples" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Media\Audio;

// Text-to-Speech
$response = Prism::audio()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'tts-1')
    ->withInput('Hello, this is a test of text-to-speech functionality.')
    ->withVoice('alloy')
    ->asAudio();

if ($response->audio->hasBase64()) {
    file_put_contents('output.mp3', base64_decode($response->audio->base64));
}

// Speech-to-Text
$audioFile = Audio::fromPath('/path/to/audio.mp3');

$response = Prism::audio()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'whisper-1')
    ->withInput($audioFile)
    ->asText();

echo $response->text; // Transcribed text
</code-snippet>

### Embeddings
- Use `Prism::embeddings()` to generate vector representations of text for semantic search and recommendations.
- Generate single or multiple embeddings in one request (except Gemini which only supports single embeddings).
- Access embeddings via `$response->embeddings[0]->embedding` which returns a float array.
- Use embeddings for similarity calculations, clustering, and semantic search implementations.

<code-snippet name="Embeddings Generation" lang="php">
// Single embedding
$response = Prism::embeddings()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'text-embedding-3-large')
    ->fromInput('Your text to embed')
    ->asEmbeddings();

$embedding = $response->embeddings[0]->embedding; // float[]
echo "Token usage: " . $response->usage->tokens;

// Multiple embeddings at once
$response = Prism::embeddings()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'text-embedding-3-large')
    ->fromInput('First text')
    ->fromInput('Second text')
    ->fromArray(['Third text', 'Fourth text'])
    ->asEmbeddings();

foreach ($response->embeddings as $embedding) {
    // Process each embedding vector
    $vector = $embedding->embedding;
}
</code-snippet>

### Performance and Best Practices
- Choose appropriate models for your use case based on speed, cost, and capability requirements.
- Consider token usage and costs when designing prompts.
- Use streaming for long-running generations to improve user experience.
- Be aware that Laravel Telescope and similar packages may interfere with streaming.
- Cache responses when appropriate to avoid redundant API calls.

### Provider-Specific Features
- Take advantage of provider-specific capabilities like OpenAI's reasoning models, Anthropic's thinking modes, and prompt caching.
- Use `withProviderOptions()` to access provider-specific parameters.
- Check provider documentation for unique features and limitations.
- Some providers support reasoning/thinking tokens that show the model's thought process.

<code-snippet name="Provider-Specific Options" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Messages\SystemMessage;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Messages\UserMessage;

// OpenAI reasoning models with different effort levels
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-5-mini')
    ->withPrompt('Solve this complex problem step by step')
    ->withProviderOptions([
        'reasoning' => ['effort' => 'high'] // 'low', 'medium', 'high'
    ])
    ->asText();

// Access reasoning token usage
$usage = $response->firstStep()->usage;
echo "Reasoning tokens: " . $usage->thoughtTokens;

// Anthropic extended thinking mode
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-7-sonnet-latest')
    ->withPrompt('Think through this complex problem carefully')
    ->withProviderOptions([
        'thinking' => ['enabled' => true, 'budget' => 2048]
    ])
    ->asText();

// Anthropic prompt caching (must use withMessages, not withPrompt)
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withMessages([
        (new SystemMessage('Long reusable system message...'))
            ->withProviderOptions(['cacheType' => 'ephemeral']),
        (new UserMessage('Long reusable user message...'))
            ->withProviderOptions(['cacheType' => 'ephemeral'])
    ])
    ->asText();

// XAI thinking mode with streaming
$stream = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::XAI, 'grok-4')
    ->withPrompt('Complex reasoning task')
    ->withProviderOptions(['thinking' => true])
    ->asStream();

foreach ($stream as $chunk) {
    if ($chunk->chunkType === ChunkType::Thinking) {
        echo "Thinking: " . $chunk->text;
    } else {
        echo "Answer: " . $chunk->text;
    }
}
</code-snippet>

### Prism Server
- Prism Server provides HTTP API access to your Prism functionality.
- Use the `PrismServer` facade to register named Prism configurations for HTTP access.
- Configure security with middleware and authentication as needed.
- Prism Server is disabled by default - enable via `PRISM_SERVER_ENABLED=true` environment variable.

<code-snippet name="Prism Server Configuration" lang="php">
// Register Prism configurations
use Prism\Prism\Facades\PrismServer;

PrismServer::register('chat-assistant', function () {
    return Prism::text()
        ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
        ->withSystemPrompt('You are a helpful assistant.');
});

// In config/prism.php
'prism_server' => [
    'enabled' => env('PRISM_SERVER_ENABLED', false),
    'middleware' => [], // Configure as needed
],
</code-snippet>

### Image Generation
- Use `Prism::image()` for AI-powered image generation with supported providers.
- Configure image parameters like size, quality, and style through provider options.
- Images are returned as base64-encoded data or URLs depending on the provider.

<code-snippet name="Image Generation" lang="php">
// Basic image generation
$response = Prism::image()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'dall-e-3')
    ->withPrompt('A serene mountain landscape at sunset')
    ->generate();

if ($response->hasImages()) {
    $image = $response->firstImage();
    if ($image->hasUrl()) {
        echo "Image URL: " . $image->url;
    }
    if ($image->hasBase64()) {
        file_put_contents('generated.png', base64_decode($image->base64));
    }
}

// With provider-specific options
$response = Prism::image()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'dall-e-3')
    ->withPrompt('Abstract art in vibrant colors')
    ->withProviderOptions([
        'size' => '1024x1024',
        'quality' => 'hd',
        'style' => 'vivid'
    ])
    ->generate();
</code-snippet>

### Provider Tools
- Some providers offer built-in tools like code execution, web search, and file analysis.
- Use `withProviderTools()` with `ProviderTool` objects to enable these capabilities.
- Provider tools can be combined with custom tools for powerful interactions.
- Each provider offers different built-in capabilities - check documentation for availability.

<code-snippet name="Provider Tools Usage" lang="php">
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\ProviderTool;
use Prism\Prism\Facades\Tool;

// Using Anthropic's code execution tool
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
    ->withPrompt('Calculate the fibonacci sequence up to 100 and plot it')
    ->withProviderTools([
        new ProviderTool(
            type: 'code_execution_20250522',
            name: 'code_execution'
        )
    ])
    ->asText();

// Combining provider tools with custom tools
$customTool = Tool::as('database_lookup')
    ->for('Look up user information')
    ->withStringParameter('user_id', 'The user ID to look up')
    ->using(function (string $userId): string {
        return User::find($userId)->toJson();
    });

$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
    ->withMaxSteps(5)
    ->withPrompt('Look up user 123 and analyze their usage statistics')
    ->withTools([$customTool])
    ->withProviderTools([
        new ProviderTool(type: 'code_execution_20250522', name: 'code_execution')
    ])
    ->asText();
</code-snippet>

### Advanced Configuration Options
- Use `withClientOptions()` to configure HTTP client settings like timeouts and retries.
- Use `withMaxTokens()`, `usingTemperature()`, and `usingTopP()` to fine-tune generation parameters.
- Override provider configuration dynamically with `usingProviderConfig()` for multi-tenant apps.

<code-snippet name="Advanced Configuration" lang="php">
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::OpenAI, 'gpt-4')
    ->withPrompt('Generate detailed analysis')
    ->withMaxTokens(2000)
    ->usingTemperature(0.7)
    ->withClientOptions([
        'timeout' => 60,
        'connect_timeout' => 10
    ])
    ->withClientRetry(3, 1000)
    ->usingProviderConfig([
        'api_key' => $userApiKey, // Multi-tenant API key
        'organization' => $userOrgId
    ])
    ->asText();
</code-snippet>

### Integration Options
- Prism integrates with Laravel features: queues, events, broadcasting, caching.
- Use Laravel's queue system for long-running AI tasks to avoid timeouts.
- The provider system allows switching between different AI services easily.
